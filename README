Game.lua

- The enemy dog is created using otherCharacter.lua 5 seconds after the start of the game
- I find the first free cell and place the enemy dog there
- I calculate the shortest path from the dog position to the first tree (wherever it is, it's not the closest one, just the first in the table)
- I use the calculated path to move there and collide with the tree





ENEMY LOGIC

-- Pathfinding
I used jumper
Jumper creates a path between two available points but my end point is a tree and it's unavailable
so I first had to find the closest available cell with function findClosestAvailableCell()

findClosestAvailableCell() creates a table with the
(x-1, y+1)
(x, y+1)
(x+1, y+1)

-- collision with other dog
This is handled on the main char function since it already checks if it does collide with trees
If it collides with the other dog it stops the level
